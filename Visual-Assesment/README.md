# Visual Assessment of Datasets
Visual assessment is simple. It involves looking at your dataset in its entirety in whatever program you like.

Visual assessment can be directed or non-directed.

- **Directed** means looking through each table within a Jupyter notebook or a spreadsheet application like Google Sheets or MS Excel. Unfortunately, some datasets are so large that spreadsheet programs crash when trying to open them, so sometimes *pandas* is the only option.
- **Non-directed** visual assessment is when you look at different pieces of tables, such as scrolling aimlessly and stumbling upon issues, then dialing in on something once you have more of a clue of what issue you've spotted. At that point, you can use more pinpointed assessments whether visual or programmatic.

Here we will be assessing or data sets visually. 
Firstly you have to acquaint yourself of what the Data Set actually contains and this is well explained in this Practice Notebook I used for the same.
